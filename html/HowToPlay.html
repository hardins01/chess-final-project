	<h2>How to play chess</h2>
	<div> The goal of this game is to take the opponent's King. Unlike in traditional chess, there are no checks</div>

	<h3> Piece Rules: </h3>
	<ul> 
		<li>The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
		<li>A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. </li>
		<li>A bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally.</li>
		<li>The queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
		<li>A knight moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares verticallyâ€”i.e. in an "L" pattern</li>
		<li> Pawns have the most complex rules of movement: 
			<ul>
				<li>A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.</li>
				<li>A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant). </li>
				<li> A promoted pawn is automatically converted to a queen, unlike in traditional chess</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

	</ul>
	<div>Note: Due to the difficulty of implementing these moves, there is no en passant</div>

	<h4> Piece Value</h4>
	<div> Each piece has a value, and this is calculated from millions of chess games conducted by engines to give a rough estimate of piece value </div>
	<ul>
		<li>Queen: 9 points</li>
		<li>Rook: 5 points</li>
		<li>Bishop: 3 points</li>
		<li>Knight: 3 points</li>
		<li>Pawn: 1 point</li>

	</ul>
